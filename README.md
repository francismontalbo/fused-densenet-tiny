# How to use:
***:heavy_exclamation_mark:If training the model, the dependencies included a `tensorflow-gpu`. You may change the `tensorflow-gpu` to `tensorflow` if no GPU is to be used. However, the results from the paper were produced using a GPU (GTX 1070)***

Dependencies included in the `requirements.txt`: 
- jupyter==1.0.0
- keras==2.2.5
- matplotlib
- numpy==1.16.2
- opencv-python==4.4.0.42
- pandas==0.25.3
- Pillow==7.2.0
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- scikit-plot
- scipy
- tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0 (Note: This is optional and can train even with just a CPU or tensorflow non-gpu variant)

***:heavy_exclamation_mark: START HERE*** You may clone using git or download the repository and extract the files manually:
- Once cloned, CD into the folder and enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
- After installation of the dependecies, there are two options to evaluate or use the model.

**First (easier):**
- Clone this repository or download as zip.
- Install the requirements on a newly created environment to prevent issues with other existing ones.
- Directly open the `model_evaluation.ipynb` and proceed with the evaluation. Then open the `model_tester.ipynb` to test it and you are done.
**The weight size of the model is only 10.3MB üòÑ named as `fused_densenet_tiny.h5` inside the `weights/` folder.**

**Second (difficult):**
- Make sure to download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WVKRTS5Wg8FdL7GCKwebIUz9jXnKx9nH?usp=sharing">PREPARED dataset</a> and extract it to a folder within the `fused-densenet-tiny/` like `fused-densenet-tiny/dataset/`
- Clone this repository or download as zip.
- Install the requirements on a newly created environment to prevent issues with other existing ones.
- Open the `model_trainer.ipynb` and train.
- Once trained, you may now use the `model_evaluation.ipynb` and `model_tester.ipynb` and you are done.

**REMEMBER THIS IS A LONGER PROCESS (Second process) TO TEST AND SIMULATE THE MODEL**
