<p><strong>Abstract</strong>: Due to the unforeseen turn of events, our world has undergone another global pandemic from a highly contagious novel coronavirus named COVID-19. The novel virus inflames the lungs similarly to Pneumonia, making it challenging to diagnose. Currently, the common standard to diagnose the virus's presence from an individual is using a molecular real-time Reverse-Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test from fluids acquired through nasal swabs. Such a test is difficult to acquire in most underdeveloped countries with a few experts that can perform the test. As a substitute, the widely available Chest X-Ray (CXR) became an alternative to rule out the virus. However, such a method does not come easy as the virus still possesses unknown characteristics that even experienced radiologists and other medical experts find difficult to diagnose through CXRs. Several studies have recently used computer-aided methods to automate and improve such diagnosis of CXRs through Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on computer vision and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), which some require heavy processing costs and other tedious methods to produce. Therefore, this work proposed the Fused-DenseNet-Tiny, a lightweight DCNN model based on a densely connected neural network (DenseNet) truncated and concatenated. The model trained to learn CXR features based on transfer learning, partial layer freezing, and feature fusion. Upon evaluation, the proposed model achieved a remarkable 97.99% accuracy, with only 1.2 million parameters and a shorter end-to-end structure. It has also shown better performance than some existing studies and other massive state-of-the-art models that diagnosed COVID-19 from CXRs.</p>

# How to use:
***:heavy_exclamation_mark:If training the model, the dependencies included a `tensorflow-gpu`. You may change the `tensorflow-gpu` to `tensorflow` if no GPU is to be used. However, the results from the paper were produced using a GPU (GTX 1070)***

Dependencies included in the `requirements.txt`: 
- jupyter==1.0.0
- keras==2.2.5
- matplotlib
- numpy==1.16.2
- opencv-python==4.4.0.42
- pandas==0.25.3
- Pillow==7.2.0
- scikit-learn
- scikit-image
- scikit-plot
- scipy
- tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0 (Note: This is optional and can train even with just a CPU or tensorflow non-gpu variant)

***:heavy_exclamation_mark: START HERE*** You may clone using git or download the repository and extract the files manually:
- Once cloned, CD into the folder and enter `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 
- After installation of the dependecies, there are two options to evaluate or use the model.

**First (easier):**
- Clone this repository or download as zip.
- Install the requirements on a newly created environment to prevent issues with other existing ones.
- Directly open the `model_evaluation.ipynb` and proceed with the evaluation. Then open the `model_tester.ipynb` to test it and you are done.
**The weight size of the model is only 10.3MB üòÑ named as `fused_densenet_tiny.h5` inside the `weights/` folder.**

**Second (difficult):**
- Make sure to download the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WVKRTS5Wg8FdL7GCKwebIUz9jXnKx9nH?usp=sharing">PREPARED dataset</a> and extract it to a folder within the `fused-densenet-tiny/` like `fused-densenet-tiny/dataset/`
- Clone this repository or download as zip.
- Install the requirements on a newly created environment to prevent issues with other existing ones.
- Open the `model_trainer.ipynb` and train.
- Once trained, you may now use the `model_evaluation.ipynb` and `model_tester.ipynb` and you are done.

**REMEMBER THIS IS A LONGER PROCESS (Second process) TO TEST AND SIMULATE THE MODEL**
